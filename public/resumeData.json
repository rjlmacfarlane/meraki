    "bioLineTwo":"As an artist, I aspire to cultivate harmonious interaction between whimsical rustic charm and modern convenience. My unique design concepts include sourcing, restoring, and integrating reclaimed architectural elements, and I work closely with local craftsmen and artisans to bring a vision to life. I am self-taught, inspired by people I've met, places I've been, an incessant need to forage; and quite simply, a love of beauty.",
